# Covid-19 Data Explorer

Data set: https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&facet=none&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=Confirmed+cases&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=true&Color+by+test+positivity=false&country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~ITA~IND 

I am utilizing a data set containing the latest covid-19 statistics, including the number of cases per million in specific countries on specific days. The data set is extensive, with over 240,000 rows and numerous columns representing various categories. However, I had to reduce the number of columns in the csv file for the purpose of this assignment and only retained 7 categories. My program organizes information based on the country and date, which simplifies things even further. By organizing the data based on the country and date, my program is able to display a specific piece of information with no overlap. Some countries might have a lot of covid-19 cases, but their actual situation might be a lot better than it seems if their population is high. The total number of cases per million people in a country more accurately represents how much of the population is getting covid-19.
